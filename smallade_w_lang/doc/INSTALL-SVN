Checking out the svn version of ADE requires a few tweaks to various
components.  Most of the supporting code is available in the svn repository
alongside ADE:

svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/rudy/ade
svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/rudy/playerstage
svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/rudy/festival
svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/rudy/sphinx4
svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/rudy/speech
svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/rudy/vision

See documentation in this directory for advice on installing and using
these.  It's probably easiest to check these all out in the same directory,
as many places in the ADE registry and servers specify paths relative to the
top-level ade directory such as ../festival.

ADE is typically installed for the standard lab user (still named "airolab"
at present), and there are several places at which paths need to be changed
to reflect the local geography.

mkade
    This is the main compilation script for the ADE framework (note that
    "./mkade" tries to compile *all* ADE servers, some of which have not been
    updated recently and, therefore, might not compile--you may want to use
    "./mkade small" instead, which compiles only a subset of the system).
    When the paths are correct, you can simply type "./mkade small" in the
    top-level ADE directory to compile the system.

    - Type "./mkade help" for a description of other options.

    - The first time you run mkade, you may be asked a couple of questions
      about where to find your java installation.

    - Make sure the RXTXcomm.jar file is in the classpath.

    - For the Simbad robot simulator client, you'll need to install Java3d
      (http://java3d.dev.java.net/) in $JAVADIR/jre.

config/<name>.config
config/<name>.hosts
    In the "config" directory are the files that specify ADE instance
    configurations and host capabilities.  Each ".config" file consists of a
    list of ADE servers to be started by the ADE registry, with details
    about how to start each.  Most of these items are optional and will be
    filled with default values. At a minimum, the 'host,' 'type,' and
    'startdirectory' items should be listed, and 'serverargs" and
    'userclasspath' are typically needed, as well.
    
    Format and valid options:
    STARTSERVER
    host           IP address or hostname
    port           the RMI port (default=1099)
    type           server class (e.g., com.test.TestServerImpl)
    name           assigned name (optional)
    conn           number of connections supported (default=10)
    tmout          reaper period
    acc            access rights
    startdirectory fully qualified directory
    userclasspath  server-specific classpath (space delimited)
    javavmargs     server-specific java vm arguments (space delimited, no
		   leading dash)
    serverargs     server-specific command-line arguments
    restarts       number of recovery attempts (default=0)
    configfile     configuration file (optional)
    credentials    additional permissions
    ENDSERVER

    Hosts are specified similarly in ".hosts" files, with information about
    what capabilities each has.  All of these entries are optional and will
    be filled with default values, as found in the ade.ADEPreferences class
    and the ade.ADEHostInfo.HostDefaultInfo enumeration.
    
    Format and valid options:
    STARTHOST
    ip           IP address or hostname
    os           operating system name
    cpus         number of CPUs (default=1)
    cpumhz       CPU speeds (default=850)
    memmb        available memory (default=256MB)
    adehome      ADE home directory
    tempdir      temporary directory (e.g., /tmp)
    javadir      Java home directory
    javabin      Java executable
    javacompiler Java compiler
    shell        command-line shell (e.g., /bin/sh)
    shellargs    shell arguments (e.g., -c)
    ping         ping command (e.g., /bin/ping)
    pingargs     ping arguments (e.g., -c 2)
    rsh          remote shell command (e.g., /bin/rsh)
    rshargs      remote shell arguments (e.g., -X -A -n)
    rcp          remote copy command (e.g., /bin/rcp)
    rcpargs      remote copy arguments (e.g., -X -A -n)
    ssh          ssh command (e.g., /bin/ssh)
    sshargs      ssh arguments (e.g., -X)
    scp          remote secure copy command (e.g., /bin/rcp)
    scpargs      remote secure copy arguments (e.g., -A -n)
    sshlogin     ssh login username
    ps           process information command (e.g., /bin/ps)
    psargs       process information command (e.g., -f)
    devices      interfaces supported on host
    ENDHOST

    See the examples in the "config" directory for ideas of the kinds of
    options that are commonly needed.

    - In the ."config" files, the "startdirectory" path should be adjusted,
      along with the "host" and "userclasspath" settings, as needed

    - In the ".hosts" files, the "adehome" path and "sshlogin" name should
      be adjusted

runaderegistry
runadeserver
    These are convenience scripts for starting ADE.  They do some things to
    try to figure out the address to use when starting and parse additional
    arguments.  Type "./runaderegistry help" and "./runadeserver help" for a
    description of options and some examples.

    - You may want to adjust the IP addresses the script uses to guess RMI
      args, etc., if they do not match your system and you're tired of
      providing them on the command line.

Interesting Windows tidbits:
When starting Java from the command line, the class file *does not* use the
standard Windows file separator; you can use either periods (standard java
package demarcation) or forward slashes (standard UNIX file separator). For
example, to start an ADE registry (which is located in the "ade" directory),
the following work (showing a full path to the java executable for comparison
purposes):

C:\adehome> C:\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\java ade.ADERegistryImpl
C:\adehome> C:\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\java ade/ADERegistryImpl

However, the following will not work:

C:\adehome> C:\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\java ade\ADERegistryImpl

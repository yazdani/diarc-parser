Power/Battery calculations:
The HostMonitor is set up to obtain power information from hosts so that
battery levels can be taken into account when choosing where to run a
server. At ADE's level, of course, power calculations are astoundingly
rough estimates at best. However, rough estimates are better than nothing.

Essentially, we're going to assume that *all* power consumption is due to
two things: (1) the CPU and (2) any additional devices attached (e.g.,
cameras, lasers, sonar, etc.). Furthermore, we're going to assume that
consumption is a simple linear function: for the CPU, it will be calculated
as: (maximum cpu wattage * cpu load), while for a device, it will be
calculated as: (maximum wattage * estimated usage). Maximum wattages are
most likely from vendor specs; the HostMonitor has an enumeration of CPU
types and wattages obtained from Wikipedia (source:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_power_dissipation). The estimated usage of
a device should be supplied as a configuration parameter, although a default
value of 0.5 is assigned if none is given.

So, we calculate the power drawn on a host by the CPU and device loads:

PD = Dcpu + Ddevs

The power drawn for the CPU is due to the core voltage, wattage, and load,
as is the power drawn for the devices:

Dcpu = W/V * load
Ddevs = sum(W/V * load)

Sanity check: airolablaptop1 (little Dell) has a 1200MHz PentiumM; so
21W/1.4V=15A. With a capacity of 2662mAh (on BAT1) and 1004mAh (on BAT2)
and running at 50% load, we have:

15A = 15000mA * 0.5 = 7500mA
3666mAh / 7500mA * 60min, which would run for about 30 minutes.

Now, airolablaptop2 (LinuxCertified) has a 2000MHz PentiumM; so 27W/1.4V=19A.
With a capacity of 3792mAh and running at 50% load, we have:

19A = 19000mA * 0.5 = 9500mA
3792mAh / 9500mA * 60min, which would run for about 20 minutes.

Since the average load is *much* lower (probably around 10%), on airolablaptop1
we would end up with:

15A = 15000mA * 0.1 = 1500mA
3666mAh / 1500mA, which would run for about 2 hours, 27 minutes.

Host:
Voltage (V):
Current (A):
Power available (W): V * A
Capacity (mAH):

Server:
Voltage (V):
Power usage (W): yields A=W/V

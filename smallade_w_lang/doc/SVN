Here's a brief summary of how to maintain your own branch for development 
and merge it back when it's stable:

1. Create the new branch:

  svn copy svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/trunk svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/branches/bestever

2. Check out the new branch:

  svn co svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/branches/bestever myade
  cd myade

3. Make whatever changes you want in there and check them in as normal.

4. When ready to commit the changes to the main trunk, first bring your 
branch up to date with the rest of the system:

  svn merge svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/trunk

then commit the branch:

  svn ci

then make sure you have an up-to-date version of the trunk:

  cd ..
  svn co svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/trunk ade

and then merge your changes back into the trunk:

  cd ade
  svn merge --reintegrate svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/branches/bestever
  svn ci

If you're done with the trunk, you can delete it:

  svn delete svn://hri.cogs.indiana.edu/projects/diarc/ade/branches/bestever

There are some ways to streamline it, but these steps will accomplish it.  
Also, the "cd" commands are just there as hints; you can check them out into 
whatever directories you want, etc.

Check the authz file to make sure the right permissions are available to
create and modify the new branch.  A snapshot can be created in much the
same way as a branch, but then specified as read-only in authz.  Someone
with root access to the server will need to check/set the permissions (i.e.,
Matthias or Paul).

The Segway server depends on the ft245 Linux kernel module.  This can be
downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftdi-usb-ft245/.  However,
there are (minor) changes that need to be made to the source in order for
the module to recognize the Segway interface when it's plugged in, so it may
be easiest to use the modified version in com/segway/ft245.tgz.

To compile the module, you need to have the kernel source in /usr/src.
Unpack the module source and (maybe as root?) make the module.  Copy ft245.ko
to /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/serial.  Run depmod.  To get
the permissions correct, add:
    
    KERNEL=="ft245*", MODE="0666"

to the file /etc/udev/local.rules.  Then run "udevcontrol reload_rules"
(optional on some systems?).  Plug in the Segway device, and the kernel
module should load and the file /dev/ft2450 should be created.

According to Linux Certified tech support, the backlight not coming back on after the lid
is closed and reopened is due to a corruption of the BIOS. To "fix" the BIOS, shutdown
the computer, remove the AC power and battery, and let the laptop sit for 10-15 seconds.
Upon powering on, press the F2 key to bring up the BIOS. Select the "Load Optimal
Configuration" from the exit menu screen, then save changes. That should fix the problem.

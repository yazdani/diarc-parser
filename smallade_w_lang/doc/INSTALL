ADE 1.0beta Installation
Copyright 2006 Airolab
========================

These are instructions for installing the ADE framework. For convenience,
it has been divided into the following sections:
1. Installation requirements
2. Automated installation of pre-compiled ADE packages
3. Installation of support software packages

Note that ADE is still a beta release. While it is currently being used
on a daily basis as a research platform, it is possible that some of the
API will change without notice. Additionally, ADE is generally executed
on Linux boxen (Debian etch and Fedora Core 4); while it should work without
modification on other operating systems, testing has not been as extensive.

1. Installation Requirements
============================

Sun recommends at least a 300MHZ processor with 256MB RAM as the minumum
configuration to run Java. Other supporting software may require better. We
have run the ADE system (comprised of an ADERegistry and at least three
ADEServers) on a robot with an on-board PC with a 850MHz PIII processor and
128MB RAM (256MB swap) using Linux (2.6.x kernel) with no problems.

ADE is available from http://ade.sourceforge.net/ in the following forms:
1. A tar archive of pre-compiled java classes and source code
2. A zip archive of pre-compiled java classes and source code

ADE requires the following supporting software to enable certain functionality
(* indicates basic requirement; note that precompiled versions of supporting
software are often available to ease installation):

Functionality      | Supporting software
-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADE base system    | * Java(c) 1.5 (or later), http://java.sun.com
Distribution       | ssh Secure shell client/server (e.g., http://www.openssh.org)
Hardware interface | RXTX(c) Java serial communications, http://www.rxtx.org

Speech Recognition | Sphinx(c), http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net
                   | Sonic(c), http://cslr.colorado.edu/beginweb/speech_recognition/sonic.html

Some additional packages that are in the process of being streamlined, but
are not yet included in the release:

Functionality      | Supporting software
-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vision             | OpenCV(c), http://opencvlibrary.sourceforge.net
                   | SIFT keypoint detector, http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints
Prolog             | SWI(c), http://www.swi-prolog.org
Conversation       | WordNet(c), 
                   | VerbNet(c),

Cognitive model    | ThoughtTreasure(tm), http://www.signiform.com/tt/htm/tt.htm

2. Installation from pre-compiled packages:
===========================================

Download the precompiled archive in the desired format. If you are using a UNIX
system, the "install" script found on the ADE sourceforge page
(http://ade.sourceforge.net) will automatically download and install the latest
version.

3. Installation of supporting software:
=======================================

Java(c) 1.5 (or later):
- Download and install the Java JDK, making note of its location

Secure shell client/server:
- To use ADE's distribution mechanisms, a secure shell client and server
  must be installed and passwordless login must be enabled. See the SSH
  documentation in the "docs/SSH" file for additional details.
  
RXTX Java serial port communication:
- We have tested and use RXTX v2.1-7pre17; newer versions may be available,
  but we cannot guarantee compatibility. Sun supplies a communications
  package also that serves the same purpose, but we have not used it.
- The following files need to be copied to your Java home directory:
  jre/lib/ext/RXTXcomm.jar
  lib/ext/comm.jar
  jre/lib/i386/librxtxI2C.so
  jre/lib/i386/librxtxParallel.so
  jre/lib/i386/librxtxRS485.so
  jre/lib/i386/librxtxRaw.so
  jre/lib/i386/librxtxSerial.so
- The following line must be added to the lib/javax.comm.properties file:
  Driver=javax.io.RXTXCommDriver

Player/Stage:
- Download and compile the Player/Stage programs, v.1.6.5 and 1.6.2 from
  http://playerstage.sourceforge.net

Festival speech production:
- Download and install the latest version of Festival from:
  http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival

Sphinx speech recognition:
- Download and install Sphinx4 from http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net

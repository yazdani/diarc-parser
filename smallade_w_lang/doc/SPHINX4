README for Sphinx4 (updated 06/05/2007)
=======================================

Needed in your classpath are jsapi.jar (for the Java Speech Grammar Format),
sphinx4.jar, and WSJ_8gau_13dCep_16k_40mel_130Hz_6800Hz.jar (these should all
be in the main directory of the ADE repository).

In addition, other problems starting sphinx might be caused by the settings
in the (sphinx4) configuration file (default is "example.gram.config.xml"--PWS:
this is a change in the default that breaks grammar switching (present in most
Action scripts); you now need to manually select the correct config by adding
"-s4conf ../sphinx4/config/jsgf.config.xml" to the serverargs for
com.sphinx4.Sphinx4ServerImpl in the ADE startup file).

Some notable things to check:
- in the "microphone" component, make sure the "selectMixer" setting is
  correct. According to the sphinx4 documentation, using "last" as the value
  *should* find an acceptable mixer. However, on at least one machine, the
  value had to be set explicitly to an appropriate mixer. Use sphinx4's
  "AudioTool" utility with the "-dumpMixers" to display the available mixers
  on the local machine.
- make sure the "path" property in the "wordListGrammar" section is set
  properly
- make sure the "dictionaryPath" and "fillerPath" properties in the
  "dictionary" section are set properly

During startup you need to pass the flag "-mx256m" to increase the Java heap
space for Sphinx 4 so it doesn't crash during startup (and/or take a very long
time to load). For example:

java -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=172.30.1.10 -mx256m \
      com/sphinx4/Sphinx4ServerImpl -l 172.30.1.10 -r 172.30.1.10

If the ADE Sphinx4Server is being used with the ADE FestivalServer, make sure
to also read the doc/FESTIVAL readme if there are other issues.

Sound Settings -- airolablaptop1
================================

To use the Shure wireless mic plugged into the onboard mic jack, mute mic capture and disable mic boost in playback settings, select mic capture and set capture level to 7 in capture settings.  The volume on the mic receiver should be turned all the way up.  In the sphinx4 config file (see above) "selectMixer" should be set to 0.

To use a mic plugged into the Acoustic Magic USB dongle, "selectMixer" should
be set to 5 (note that this varies from machine to machine depending on what
other hardware is installed).  The mic settings can be modified using alsamixer
("alsamixer -c 2"); not sure about reasonable settings--please update when you
find out (probably specific to which mic is plugged in, normally the mic
array).

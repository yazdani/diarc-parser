<!-- GENERAL NOTES:  

    * The coordinate system is Euclidean.  NOTE THAT THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM
      THE SCREEN COORDINATE SYSTEM, WHERE Y grows DOWN, not up!  all numbers
      can be doubles. 
    * The Z dimension, to the extent that it is used, points UPWARDS.
    * All measurements are in METERS and RADIANS
    * The entire configuration MUST BE ENCLOSED within the <config> tag.
    
    
  A note about NUMERICAL PARAMETERS:
    * Expressions are EVALUATED.  Therefore, you can write things like
      x="5.32 * 6"
    * Note that you do NOT need to put a decimal after division - though you
      can if it makes you feel better.
    * You can use the constant PI.  I.e.: theta="PI / 4"
    * You can use the built-in constant RAND which is very handy, but
      OVERLOADED WITH MEANING:
      * For angles, RAND is anywhere between 0 and 2*PI.  Hence, if you set
        the robot's theta to RAND, it will face in any possible direction.
      * Everywhere else, RAND is a number between 0 and 1.  Hence, you can
        set the fraction by which a door is open to RAND.  Or the position
        of a block as "x = 3 + (4*RAND)"
    * Finally, constants are NOT cASe SenSitiVE.  Write them as awkwardly as
      you wish...
    
  possible tokens: 
    <world [*opt* bounded="true/false" (true by default)]>
      <shape> {particular_shape} <shape>
    </world>.  

    * Note that EACH FILE MUST SPECIFY WORLD DIMENSIONS.
    * Bounded refers to whether the simulation should automatically put in
      walls at the world's edge, so that the robot does not drive off
      into nothingness.  It is true by default.

    shape_and_optional_actions are just comprised of a SINGLE shape node,
    and optional actions.  let's start with shape:  

    <shape [*opt* z="0"] [*opt* zLength="ï¿½"] [*opt* rotation="0"] >
      {particular_shape}
    </shape> 
    
    the particular shape can be: 

    <rect [*opt* x="0"] [*opt* y="0"] [*opt* center="False"] xLength="" yLength="" />  
    
    where (x,y) is bottom left coordinate, UNLESS center="True" is
    specified, in which case (x,y) is the CENTER (useful for placing
    percepts, i.e., boxes and blocks).
    
    <poly>
      <pt x="" y=""/>
      <pt x="" y=""/>
      ...
    </poly>
    
    for a polygon.

    the actions can be OPTIONALLY surrounded by an 
    
    <actions>
      {action_item}[s]
    </actions>
    
    node, but that is for backwards compatibility only;  they can also just
    reside within the shape.  a shape can have zero, one, or many actions.

    an action_item can be one of the following: 

    <action> <message text="" /> </action> 

    <action> <exit/> </action> 
    
    <action> <remove/> </action>
    
    <action> <push/> </action>
      (to bulldoze the object in same direction as robot is moving, but
      bounded by walls).
    
    <action> <pushDoor/> </action>
      (ONLY APPLICABLE TO PUSHING DOORS OPEN/CLOSED).
    
    the actions will be executed (IN ORDER) whenever one of the robot lines
    intersects one of the lines of the shape. 

    objects can be: 

    <wall>    {shape_and_optional_actions}   </wall> 

    <door [*opt* name=""] openFraction="[0 through 1.0]" 
          x="" y="" width="" thickness="" closed_angle="" pivot_angle=""/>
      {optional_color}
      {optional_actions}
    </door>
    
    where (x,y) specify pivot point, the closed angle refers to the angle of
    the door when closed (relative to the pivot point, where east = 0,
    north = PI/2, etc), and pivot_angle refers to the angle difference
    (typically +/- ~PI/2.0) relative to the closed_angle that the door
    should swing to when opened.  Note that pivot_angle of magnitude PI or
    greater may cause problems when used in conjunction with a pushDoor
    action.
    
    <landmark [*opt* name=""] [*opt* laserable="false"]>
      {shape_and_optional_actions}
    </landmark>  
    
    <block [*opt* name=""] [*opt* laserable="true"] >
      [*opt* {color}] {shape_and_optional_actions}
    </block>.
    
    <box [*opt* name=""]>
      [*opt* {color}] {shape_and_optional_actions} [*opt* {contains}]
    </box>.
            
    the color node is of one of two forms:
    
    <color name="" />
    
    where "name" is any color name specified within
    com.adesim.ColorConverter.java.
    
    <color red="" green="" blue="" />
    
    where red, green, and blue are ints 0-255.  When the sim is asked for
    colors by name, it will use the ColorConverter to find the closest named
    color for the specified RGB.
        
    the <contains> node allows to specify objects that are, at startup,
    present inside of boxes or in the robot's possession (see
    <init-robot-positions> below).  It looks like this:
    
    <contains>
      {block} (see specs above)
      ...
    </contains>
    
    note that in the case of contained objects, x and y really don't matter,
    as they'll be put in the middle of the box (if contained in a box), or
    outstretched in front of the robot (in case of robot).
    
    for rectangular objects, feel free to omit the "x" and "y" attributes
    altogether; for polygons, create the shape using the x-s and y-s, but
    know that your polygon will be moved anyway (which means you can
    construct the polygon with whatever coordinate shift is easiest for you)

    it is also possible to *optionally* specify an initial starting position
    for the robot(s):
    
    <init-robot-positions>
      <position x="" y ="" theta="">
        [*opt* {contains}]
      </position> (for first robot that joins the simulation)
      <position x="" y ="" theta=""/> (for second robot)
      ...
    </init-robot-positions>

    where (x,y) are the coordinates, and theta is the robot's angle, in
    radians or "rand", with 0 facing right, and the angle growing
    counter-clockwise.  Note that if a particular initial position is
    explicitly specified on the command line, it WILL override the
    init-robot spec.

This directory is meant to contain only interfaces, so that
all servers implementing them remain consistent. The methods
in each interface should match those given in the
agent.sensors.* and agent.effectors.* files. The interfaces
are separate because the agent interfaces extend the
agent.Sensor class, whereas these extend Remote.
